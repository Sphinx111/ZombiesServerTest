<h1>Zombies!</h1>

A visually simple game built in the Processing Library for Java. 
Whilst the visuals are kept simple, the game mechanics are what makes this fun to play. 
The humans might be slightly faster, but they're outnumbered. They might be armed, but the zombies are nearly impervious to gunfire. 
Working together as a team, a coordinated hail of gunfire can push the pursuing zombies back, but the tight corridors and winding routes make it a race against time as the zombies can only be held at bay for so long.

<h4>Installation</h4>

To run the game, you'll need to download Processing, v3 or higher.
You will also need to use the Processing editor to download the following packages:
* box2d
* minim

Unpack the zipped "testmap.txt" into your Processing folder, at the same level as the processing.exe editor. 
Open the project in the Processing editor, and press the "Play" button at the top left of the editor. 

<h4>How to play</h4>

This is a very early testing version that requires more work. A single map is provided that includes examples of key features.
* Press "P" to toggle Pause. The game starts paused. The zombies will move immediately on unpausing.
* W-A-S-D control your characters movement. 
* move the mouse to aim / look around
* left click to shoot.
* press "R" to reload your weapon (it will also reload automatically when the magazine empties)
* Move your character over the red blocks to open the nearby doors (doors are darker grey blocks)

If the zombies catch any team member, they will be turned immediately, and will try to infect you too!
